E-commerce website 
I created a test case for evaluation on the platform of a particular e-commerce company. This included testing the login functionality for both their e-commerce website and Facebook login. In addition, I looked at some functionality related to a survey-based company. It involves evaluating the process of asking users questions and aggregating their responses.
